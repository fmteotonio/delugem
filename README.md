# delugem

**delugem** was made as a C++ and SDL 2.0 exercise over the course of two weeks. It is an implementation of an advancing block puzzle where **groups of gems with the same colour can be broken by clicking on them**. Periodically, new columns of gems appear in the right side of the screen. If any gem crosses the _"End Zone"_ threshold, the game is over. Try to break large groups of gems to rack up higher scores!

Players can also force a new column to appear through the **Push** button and fill the whole board with gems in case they get stuck with the **Fill** button (only three times per game, though). On the top of the screen the current level and score are displayed, as well as the required score to level up. Whenever a new level is reached, the board resets to its initial position!
